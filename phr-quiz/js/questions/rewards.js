        text: "A tech firm's compensation data shows 25% pay disparity in similar roles. HR must analyze equity issues. What's the most effective approach?",
        options: [
            "Present salary range distributions",
            "Apply regression analysis to identify systemic pay factors",
            "Share market benchmark data",
            "Review performance ratings correlation"
        ],
        correctAnswer: "Apply regression analysis to identify systemic pay factors",
        explanation: "Regression analysis systematically identifies underlying pay disparities while controlling for legitimate factors, enabling strategic correction. Range distributions describe tactically, benchmarks compare externally, and ratings correlation addresses only performance factors."

        text: "A healthcare provider's benefits utilization shows 30% below target despite high costs. HR needs to analyze participation barriers. What's the best analytical method?",
        options: [
            "Track enrollment trends",
            "Model cost-value analysis against employee segments",
            "Share industry benchmarks",
            "Review communication metrics"
        ],
        correctAnswer: "Model cost-value analysis against employee segments",
        explanation: "Cost-value analysis by segment provides systemic insight into benefit value perception and barriers. Trends describe tactically, benchmarks compare externally, and communication metrics focus narrowly on awareness."

        text: "A company's sales incentive program shows declining motivation despite market-competitive payouts. What's the most rigorous analytical approach?",
        options: [
            "Present payout distribution data",
            "Apply expectancy theory metrics to evaluate motivation factors",
            "Share competitor incentive plans",
            "Review sales performance trends"
        ],
        correctAnswer: "Apply expectancy theory metrics to evaluate motivation factors",
        explanation: "Expectancy theory metrics systematically evaluate effort-reward relationships and perceived value. Distributions describe tactically, competitor plans benchmark narrowly, and performance trends show symptoms without causes."

        text: "An organization's merit budget faces cuts while targeting high performance. HR must analyze impact. What's the most strategic contribution?",
        options: [
            "Share historical merit trends",
            "Model retention risk against compensation elasticity",
            "Present market pay gaps",
            "Review performance distribution"
        ],
        correctAnswer: "Model retention risk against compensation elasticity",
        explanation: "Modeling retention risk with compensation elasticity provides systemic insight into budget impact on talent retention. Trends describe tactically, gaps compare externally, and performance distribution shifts focus from retention."

        text: "A retail chain's variable pay program shows inconsistent impact across locations. HR needs to analyze effectiveness. What's the best approach?",
        options: [
            "Track payout variations",
            "Analyze store performance factors with pay-productivity correlation",
            "Share industry incentive data",
            "Review employee feedback themes"
        ],
        correctAnswer: "Analyze store performance factors with pay-productivity correlation",
        explanation: "Analyzing performance factors with pay correlation provides systemic insight into program effectiveness. Variations describe tactically, industry data compares externally, and feedback themes provide limited perspective."
