        ],
        correctAnswer: "Review data backup and audit trails from migration",
        explanation: "Reviewing backups and audit trails systematically addresses data integrity during migration while maintaining historical records. This combines data backup and audit trail functionality. Creating new records loses history, training doesn't recover data, and documentation doesn't solve the immediate issue."

        ],
        correctAnswer: "Analyze user interface interaction data for barriers",
        explanation: "Analyzing UI interaction data systematically identifies specific user experience barriers affecting completion rates. This addresses the root cause through user interface assessment. Shortening acts without analysis, staffing doesn't address usability, and changing vendors is premature."

            "Increase data collection frequency",
            "Share all available metrics"
        ],
        correctAnswer: "Apply data storytelling principles with actionable insights",
        explanation: "Data storytelling with actionable insights makes complex data meaningful and drives decision-making through clarity and relevance. Raw trends lack context, frequency doesn't improve understanding, and sharing all metrics reduces focus."

        ],
        correctAnswer: "Combine diagnostic and predictive analytics for comprehensive insight",
        explanation: "Combining diagnostic analytics (why turnover occurred) with predictive analytics (future turnover risk) provides both root causes and future prevention strategies. Basic calculations describe tactically, exit summaries inform partially, and benchmarks miss internal causes."

        ],
        correctAnswer: "Apply sentiment analysis with thematic coding",
        explanation: "Sentiment analysis with thematic coding systematically analyzes both quantitative and qualitative data for comprehensive understanding. Focusing on scores ignores context, disregarding data loses insight, and averaging oversimplifies complexity."

        ],
        correctAnswer: "Implement prescriptive analytics with clear recommendations",
        explanation: "Prescriptive analytics transforms trend data into actionable recommendations, making it immediately relevant for managers. More history adds complexity, reducing data loses insight, and adding metrics doesn't improve relevance."

        ],
        correctAnswer: "Create separate, secure storage for confidential medical records",
        explanation: "Medical records must be stored separately from personnel files to protect confidentiality and prevent their use in employment decisions. Passwords alone don't address separation, restriction is insufficient, and labels don't ensure proper segregation."
